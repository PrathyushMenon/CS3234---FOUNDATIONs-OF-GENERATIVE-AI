Image Prompt:
Role:
Role:
You are an award-winning AAA esports visual designer and key-art specialist who creates cinematic, image-driven posters for major international esports tournaments and gaming conventions.

Task:
Create ONE ultra-premium, highly graphic, image-dominant poster for the event titled:
“RV University Collegiate Esports Festival”.

This poster must look like professional esports key art — not a simple graphic layout.
It should feel cinematic, layered, and visually rich, with multiple high-quality image elements blended together into one cohesive composition.

The design should immediately communicate:
scale, competition, intensity, and modern esports culture.

The poster must include:
- A powerful, dominant headline integrated into the artwork (not floating text)
- Event date & time (placeholder acceptable)
- Venue: RV University campus / auditorium
- Strong visual representation of ALL five games using game-inspired imagery:
  - League of Legends → fantasy characters / magical combat / epic energy
  - Teamfight Tactics → strategy boards / champions / tactical overlays
  - Age of Empires → medieval warfare / empires / armies / castles
  - CS2 → tactical shooter visuals / weapons / smoke / urban combat
  - FIFA → football action / stadium lighting / dynamic motion
- These game visuals should be blended together using:
  layered compositing, masks, lighting overlays, depth effects, and motion cues
- Sponsor strip placeholder at the bottom (clean rectangular logo slots)
- QR code placeholder integrated naturally into the layout (not awkwardly placed)

Background & Visual Depth:
- Use complex backgrounds: gradients, digital grids, particles, fog, light streaks, and abstract esports textures
- Foreground, midground, and background must be clearly separated to create depth
- Use lighting and shadows to guide the viewer’s eye toward the title

Context:
- Audience: college students, competitive gamers, esports fans, and sponsors
- Event type: inter-college esports tournament
- Tone: intense, premium, competitive, cinematic
- Visual identity: collegiate pride + hardcore esports aesthetics
- The poster should feel suitable for:
  large-scale print banners, social media, and official university promotions

Constraints:
- Choose ONLY ONE style direction and execute it fully and boldly:
  1) Hero Cyber:
     futuristic esports arena, neon accents, holographic HUD elements,
     cyberpunk lighting, RGB highlights, digital overlays
  2) Minimal Collegiate:
     extremely polished, luxury university branding with esports power,
     restrained colors but highly detailed imagery and typography
  3) Retro Pixel:
     modern high-resolution reinterpretation of pixel/arcade visuals,
     bold contrast, nostalgic gaming energy with contemporary polish

- The design must be image-first, text-second
- Avoid flat graphic design or poster-template look
- Use strong contrast, dramatic lighting, and layered composition
- Aspect ratio: vertical poster (2:3)

Output Requirements:
- A single finalized poster image
- Clear focal point in the upper or central area
- Event title must be readable from a distance
- Visual quality should resemble official esports tournament marketing art

Optional Enhancements (Strongly Encouraged):
- Cinematic depth-of-field blur
- Rim lighting, glow effects, volumetric lighting
- Action poses and motion effects
- Esports-grade typography integrated into the artwork
- Subtle HUD or UI-inspired graphic elements

- Mentions the featured games naturally
- Ends with a strong call to action:

Tone:
Modern esports advertisement style.
Energetic, motivational, and exciting.
Not slow, not cinematic storytelling — more like a hype ad.
